### **Effectively Final in Java** ☕️📚

In Java, a **variable is considered effectively final** if its value **does not change after it is initialized**, even if it **is not explicitly declared as `final`**. This concept was introduced in **Java 8** to simplify the usage of variables in **lambda expressions** and **inner classes**.

### ✅ **Why Effectively Final?**

Before Java 8, if you wanted to use a variable in a **local inner class**, **anonymous class**, or a **lambda expression**, you had to explicitly declare it as `final`.

- **Java 7 Example (explicit final required):**
    ```java
    public void method() {
        final int x = 10; // Must be declared final
        Runnable r = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println(x);
            }
        };
    }
    ```

In **Java 8**, the `final` keyword is no longer mandatory, as long as the variable isn't **modified after initialization**.

- **Java 8 Example (effectively final):**
    ```java
    public void method() {
        int x = 10; // No need for final if x is not reassigned
        Runnable r = () -> System.out.println(x);
    }
    ```

### ✅ **Effectively Final Rule**

A variable is effectively final if:
1. It is **assigned only once**.
2. Its value **does not change after the assignment**.

If a variable is reassigned, it **loses its effectively final status**, and you'll get a **compilation error** if used in a **lambda** or **inner class**.

**Invalid Example:**
```java
public void method() {
    int x = 10;
    x = 20; // Reassignment makes x no longer effectively final
    
    Runnable r = () -> System.out.println(x); // Compilation error!
}
```

**Error:**
```
Local variable x defined in an enclosing scope must be final or effectively final
```

### ✅ **Why is This Important?**

- **Thread Safety:** Prevents side effects caused by variable mutation.
- **Consistency:** Lambda expressions and inner classes are designed to work with immutable data.
- **Simplifies Code:** Reduces boilerplate (`final`) without sacrificing immutability.
